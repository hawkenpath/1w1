# About

Hi there! I’m Harshitha, a final-year Computer Science and Engineering student with a passion for building meaningful solutions and making an impact through technology. 

Over the past three years, I’ve been honing my Python skills and diving deep into Data Science and Machine Learning, areas I’ve truly come to love. My journey has taken me across national and international internships, giving me hands-on experience and shaping the way I approach challenges. 

At Université de Sherbrooke’s Labrie Lab (Qubéc, Canada) , I discovered my love for research. It was an incredible experience where I strengthened my skills in Python, data visualization, web development, and executing end-to-end projects. 

During my time with Alcovex Product Studio, I worked on Interview Buddy, gaining valuable insights into building ML pipelines, designing and evaluating models, working with Docker, and benchmarking processes. 

Beyond work, I’m deeply involved in the tech community. I love connecting with people, sharing knowledge, conducting sessions, and speaking at events—it’s my way of giving back and staying inspired. 

I’m always on the lookout for opportunities to learn, grow, and collaborate on projects that make a difference. Let’s connect and create something amazing together! 🚀
